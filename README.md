# Recipes

Just a list of my favorite recipes, hopefully in a form I'll find more readable, even if I'm
busy panicking in the kitchen. üòÅ

# Intellectual Property Considerations

Any recipes here are ultimately based on existing ones I've found online, and I'll try to give
attribution whenever I know the original source.

This repository shouldn't run afoul of US intellectual property law, because [according to the
U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html#recipe), only the
*expression* of a recipe is copyrightable, not the recipe itself; all prose, images, formatting,
etc in this repository are original works authored by me.
