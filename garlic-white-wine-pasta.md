# Garlic & White Wine Pasta

(based on [Garlic Butter White Wine Pasta (side dish) from Epicurious](https://web.archive.org/web/20240421093110/http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/garlic-butter-white-wine-pasta-side-dish-50049114)
but that appears to have suffered link rot)

## Ingredients

* **Garlic** (1-3 bulbs)
* **Italian parsley** (about 1/2 cup)
* **Butter** (4 tbsp)
* **Crushed red pepper** (1-3 tsp)
* **Rosemary** (1-3 tsp)
* **Salt** (1 tsp) (optional if butter is salted)
* **Ground black pepper** (1 tsp)
* **White wine** (1/2 cup)
* **Pasta** (16oz) (I like cavatappi)
* **Parmesan cheese** (1/4 cup?) (Follow Your Heart is good)
* **Tofurky italian sausage** (0-2, sliced)

## Prep

Don't forget to start heating the pasta water.

Use fresh garlic and chop it into half-cloves (or so).

Chop up about a half a bunch of italian parsley (the frilly kind is fine too).

Slice italian sausage if you're using it. (it's also fine to procrastinate on this step until everything is done)

## Cooking

### Garlic white wine sauce

In a tiny sauce pan on **medium heat**, melt:
* **Butter** (4 tbsp)

Assuming your pasta takes about 10 minutes to cook, start boiling it about now.

Mix in:
* **Garlic** (1-3 bulbs, chopped into half-cloves)
* **Crushed red pepper** (1-3 tsp)
* **Rosemary** (1-3 tsp)

Saute for about **2-5 minutes** until the garlic is barely starting to get translucent.

Mix in:
* **Salt** (1 tsp) (optional if butter is salted)
* **Ground black pepper** (1 tsp)
* **White wine** (1/2 cup)

Bring that to a slight boil, then let it simmer on **low heat**. Turn off the heat before the pasta is ready.

### Finishing

If you're feeling fancy, quickly fry up the italian sausage in the sauce pan after that's empty, otherwise 30 seconds in the microwave is fine.

When the pasta is done, mix together:
* **Cookied pasta**
* **Garlic white wine sauce**
* **Parsley**
* **Parmesan cheese** (if you're using Follow Your Heart, start light)
* **Tofurky Italian Sausage**

Enjoy!
